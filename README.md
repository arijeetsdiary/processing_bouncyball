# processing_bouncyball
This is a bouncy ball game made with Processing (Java)

## Description
When run, a screen of size of 640pixel by 480pixel (resizeable) pops up. 5 balls are thrown into the screen from the left side of the screen, each at different angles and having different masses, each time from a different random height and the balls follow a trajectory path. There is a slider which is designed as a hat of DJ Marshmello. The balls bounce off the hat and never exits the screen, but the game is over when any of the balls hit the ground. The balls can be collected in the basket and player pockets $5 for each ball he puts in the basket and new balls are thrown. The background is created to give a ghost theme to the game.

## Improvements
The game could be modified to prompt the user for another game when he failed one. Also the background could be changed and different objects could be added to give the game a different look and feel.
